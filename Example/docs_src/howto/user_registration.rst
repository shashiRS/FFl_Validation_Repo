TSF User registration
=====================

In order to be able to generate reports and testruns in the oracle, database one has to be registered in the TSF Users table. This would allow for not only generating reports but also labeling assessments using Matchbox or other labeling tools.
Please follow the following steps for successful registration in the TSF database:

#. Navigate to this link: https://tsf-webui.conti.de/login/

#. Sign in with your windows credentials and you would be directed to the TSF Web UI landing page.
