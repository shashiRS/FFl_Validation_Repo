Expected Result Interval
=========================

This page will explain the usage of the expected result as an interval.


Usage
------

The expected result can be instantiated either directly or by giving it as a string.
Numerator is used as the lower limit and numerator2 as the upper limit. Both limits of the interval are inclusive. As an operator the RelationOperator.BETWEEN has to be set.
If a denominator is used, it will be a common and applied to both numerators.
If the expected result is given as a string, it has to be in the following way: "[numerator (/denominator), numerator2 (/denominator)]"
There will be a value error, if two different denominators will be used.


Confidence
-----------

The confidence calculation will use the mean value of the two numerators.
